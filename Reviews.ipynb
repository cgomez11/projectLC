    "2)  Different mass constraints if it is a Milky Way or Andromeda Candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The important issue is not having two galaxies in the simulation consistent with the exact values of the MW and M31. Simply because it's highly unlikely to find two galaxies with the same masses at the same time. That's why all papers only use a lower bound for the masses (stellar or dark). Keeping this in mind, getting right the minimal mass is the only important parameter."
