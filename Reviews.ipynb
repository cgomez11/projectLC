    "- The important issue is not having two galaxies in the simulation consistent with the exact values of the MW and M31. Simply because it's highly unlikely to find two galaxies within the observational mass range at the same time. That's why all papers only use a lower bound for the masses (stellar or dark). Keeping this in mind, **getting right a minimal mass is the only important parameter**. \n",
